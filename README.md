# simple_sentiment_analysis_model

Just a simple sentiment analysis model to introduce myself into the world of NLP.
I used the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140 but had to reduce it to 150 000 data points, 
because my computer can't handle that many data points. (The original dataset has 1.6 million)
